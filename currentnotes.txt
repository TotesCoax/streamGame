NOW things to do 



    build user interface
        -> have client code pick apart transmitted board object
            DONE->Player and Scenario parser mostly works
            DONE->need to workout a way to adjust classes based on player.status
        -> also the functionality programming (use socket.io?)



Near future THINGS TO DO

    Correct the reroll system
        DONE(?) Sync each reroll -> rules state they must be rerolled at the same time
            This just requires consolidating the current functions into a single activation
                Still want to keep them separate for item potentially
        Reroll adjusting stage effects also need to be carved out.
            Perhaps introduce a clear effects function for stages so that we may modify effects on each stage?

    Lock/Unlock tier 2 and 3 attacks for players based on level
        need to program in a checker of sorts
        -really just need to program in something to stop them from accessing higher attacks early rather than unlocking them later, as the data is always on the card.

    When will players be allowed to trade items? (can reuse giveItem() function)
        ->At the start of each stage?
        ->Def allowed to give them on acquisition

    DONE program in abilities

    DONE program in items

    DONE program in stage effects

    prevent user from selecting a playstyle that has already been chosen

    implement attack augments:
        pierce
        heal
        split (50/50)

    Eccentric/Serene playstyle additions

    Add <meter> bar HTML tag to player cards and get functioning health bar display (value kept for testing environment)
        on hover have health bar display actual values
