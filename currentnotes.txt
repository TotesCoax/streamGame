NOW things to do 


    Learn React so that I can ->
        build user interface
            -> have client code pick apart transmitted board object
                -Player and Scenario parser mostly works
                ->need to workout a way to adjust classes based on player.status
            -> also the functionality programming (use socket.io?)



Near future THINGS TO DO

    Correct the reroll system
        Sync each reroll -> rules state they must be rerolled at the same time
            This just requires consolidating the current functions into a single activation
                Still want to keep them separate for item potentially
        Reroll adjusting stage effects also need to be carved out.
            Perhaps introduce a clear effects function for stages so that we may modify effects on each stage?

    Lock/Unlock tier 2 and 3 attacks for players based on level
        need to program in a checker of sorts

    program in abilities

    program in items

    implement attack augments:
        pierce
        heal
        split (50/50)
