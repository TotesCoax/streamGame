NOW things to do 


    build user interface
        -> have client code pick apart transmitted board object
            -Player and Scenario parser mostly works
            ->need to workout a way to adjust classes based on player.status
        -> also the functionality programming (use socket.io?)



Near future THINGS TO DO

    Correct the reroll system
        Sync each reroll -> rules state they must be rerolled at the same time
            This just requires consolidating the current functions into a single activation
                Still want to keep them separate for item potentially
        Reroll adjusting stage effects also need to be carved out.
            Perhaps introduce a clear effects function for stages so that we may modify effects on each stage?

    Lock/Unlock tier 2 and 3 attacks for players based on level
        need to program in a checker of sorts

    program in abilities

    program in items

    program in stage effects

    implement attack augments:
        pierce
        heal
        split (50/50)

    Eccentric/Serene additions

    Add progress bar HTML tag to player cards and get functioning health bar display (value kept for testing environment)
        on hover have health bar display actual values
