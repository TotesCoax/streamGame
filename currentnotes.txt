NOW things to do 

    verify abilities are being refreshed after each scenario is cleared
    
    If a player keeps all, are they still deducted a reroll? - something to consider/fix.
        -> currently they do get deducted.

    --DONE-- Need to make a template for the attackhand
        - also need to figure out a way to submit dice to attacks from item -> It's a button for now.
            - initial idea is draggable items for the dice

    -- DONE when the dice are returned to the attackhand after a failed attack, they need to have submitted set to false.

    -- DONE (pending testing) endPhase needs to trigger appropriate starts for next phase


    build user interface
        -> have client code pick apart transmitted board object
            DONE->Player and Scenario parser mostly works
            DONE->need to workout a way to adjust classes based on player.status
            ->Interactivity:
                - DONE Dice rolling
                - DONE Ability Usage
                - Items
        -> also the functionality programming (use socket.io?)

    Include basic attack requirements in the card so you can bring that over to the HUD to show players
        -> include a value propety and rework the functions to call up this value rather than having it hard coded into the function?

    Prevent the players from using consumables outside of the proper timing. Right now there is no server stop for this.



Near future THINGS TO DO

    Convert decks and cards into classes to make them far more modular and easier to import.

    Correct the reroll system
        Sync each reroll -> rules state they must be rerolled at the same time
            This just requires consolidating the current functions into a single activation
                Still want to keep them separate for item potentially
        DONE Reroll adjusting stage effects also need to be carved out.
            Perhaps introduce a clear effects function for stages so that we may modify effects on each stage?

    Lock/Unlock tier 2 and 3 attacks for players based on level
        need to program in a checker of sorts
        -really just need to program in something to stop them from accessing higher attacks early rather than unlocking them later, as the data is always on the card.

    When will players be allowed to trade items? (can reuse giveItem() function)
        ->At the start of each stage?
        ->Def allowed to give them on acquisition

    DONE program in abilities

    DONE program in items

    DONE program in stage effects

    prevent user from selecting a playstyle that has already been chosen

    implement attack augments:
        pierce
        heal
        split (50/50)

    Eccentric/Serene playstyle additions
        -> their counters will be in inventory, but give them type of counter, so at the end of scenario you can remove all counters in inventory.
            -> their timing can be treated as needed and should be able to sneak in to existing functions

    Add <meter> bar HTML tag to player cards and get functioning health bar display (value kept for testing environment)
        on hover have health bar display actual values
